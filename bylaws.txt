the Collective Intelligence Project

The Collective Intelligence Framework Project (CIF) is an open-source based
project framework dedicated to developing actionable, usable tool frameworks
tailored to meet security operations intelligence needs. Strong governance 
must be established for the CIF Project to ensure the long term success and 
stability of the Collective Intelligence Framework project.

There are four participation groups within the umbrella of the CIF Project:

Committers

Any "significant and sustained" contributor to the CIF project is
eligible for membership. Although it is difficult to specify a precise
definition, a contributor generally must have contributed to a
non-trivial improvement of the the CIF project or CIF's activity.
Contributions may be code, documentation, translations, maintenance of
project-wide resources or other non-trivial activities which benefit
the CIF project. Committer eligibility is an individual determination: while
contributions made in the course of employment will be considered, they
will generally be ascribed to the individuals involved, rather than
accruing to all employees of a "contributing" corporation. Initial
membership of the Committers will be identified in a document included
with the formation documentation of the CIF project. A Committer Membership and
Elections Committee will be established to maintain Committer membership.

All committers must complete a copyright assignment to the CIF project. 
The CIF project will make all of the code assigned to it available to the 
public under various licenses as denoted by each repository. By default, 
where applicable, and unless otherwise specified, the LGPL v2.1.

Community

Any member of the public can become a CIF project Community Participant. All
Committers are also automatically Community Participants. Community
Participants must agree that their participation as Community
Participants is in their individual capacity and not on behalf of any
corporate entity or other organization. The Community may be asked by
the Board of Directors from time to time to vote on certain issues.

Advisory Board

The Advisory Board is made up of individuals, community members and
organizations that support the CIF project. The Advisory Board has no
corporate decision-making authority but provides a vehicle for its
members to communicate with the Board and help the Directors guide the
overall direction of the CIF project. The Advisory Board will
appoint up to five (5) members who will be non-voting attendees of Board
meetings. The Advisory Board will meet up to twice per year. The
Advisory Board may be asked by the Board of Directors from time to time
to vote upon certain issues relevant to the the CIF project, such
as on particular feature sets to develop.

Initial membership of the Advisory Board shall be boot-strapped by the 
founding project members for the period of up to two years. At the end
of the boot-strapping period; Advisory Board members shall be by nomination 
and vote by the Community Members.

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors will initially consist of seven (7) members, boot-strapped by the founding project members. Future boards will be elected annually by the Committers and Advisory Board. The Board shall
meet up to twice per year to discuss various topics pertaining to
the regular activities of the CIF project.

The members of the Board may be removed from the position at any time by
a majority vote of the Committers and Advisory Board. Upon the
resignation or removal of a member of the Board, the Committers shall
elect a replacement Director.

At times an issue may arise that merits gathering consensus from the
community. Any Committer, Community Participant or Advisory Board member
can suggest a referendum. To be accepted, a request for a referendum
must be endorsed by 20% of any of (a) the Committers, (b) the Community
Participants or (c) the Advisory Board members.

A 75% vote of all of the Committers can override a Board decision.

The bylaws may be amended by a 75% vote of all the Committers.
