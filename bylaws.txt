ARTICLE 2 MEMBERSHIP

The Collective Intelligence Foundation is a member-based organization. Membership is divided into the following categories: "Founding Members", “Full Members”,"Commercial Members", "Start-Up Members", "Laison Members" and “Contributors”. Where not otherwise specified, “Member” refers to “Full Member”.

A Full Member is a trusted member of the organization who is actively contributing to the organization and/or its reputation.

A Commerical or Start-Up Member is a member who joins, contributes to and has an interest in commercializing tools and frameworks developed within the community. These members typically offer some value add to communities outside our membership reach.

A Laision Member is an individual (rather than a corporate entity) that has intrinsic value to the Foundation. These members are typically individuals who find value in the community, regularly contribute to the communities sustainability.

To help finance the operations of the community, members will pay a yearly fee which will also entitle them to major releases of specified frameworks under more permissive licensing terms for the period of one year. Such period may be renewed at the discression of the board of directors.
