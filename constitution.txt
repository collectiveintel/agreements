the Collective Intelligence Project

The Collective Intelligence Framework Project (CIF) is an open-source based project framework dedicated to developing actionable, usable tool frameworks tailored to meet security operations intelligence needs. Strong governance must be established for the CIF Project to ensure the long term success and stability of the Collective Intelligence framework project.

There are four participation groups within the umbrella of the CIF Project:

Community

Any member of the public can become a CIF project Community Participant. All Committers are also automatically Community Participants. Community Participants must agree that their participation as Community Participants is in their individual capacity and not on behalf of any corporate entity or other organization. The Community may be asked by the Leadership Board from time to time to vote on certain issues.

Committers

Any "significant and sustained" contributor to the CIF project is eligible for membership. Although it is difficult to specify a precise definition, a contributor generally must have contributed to a non-trivial improvement of the the CIF project or CIF's activity. Contributions may be code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources or other non-trivial activities which benefit the CIF project. Committer eligibility is an individual determination: while contributions made in the course of employment will be considered, they will generally be ascribed to the individuals involved, rather than accruing to all employees of a "contributing" corporation. Initial membership of the Committers will be identified in a document included with the formation documentation of the CIF project. A Committer Membership and Elections Committee will be established to maintain Committer membership.

All committers are encouraged complete a copyright assignment to the CIF project. The CIF project will make all of the code assigned to it available to the public under various licenses as denoted by each repository. By default, where applicable, and unless otherwise specified, the LGPL v2.1. If an assignment is not completed, through the act of a "pull-request", the contributor assumes the full transfer of ownership of the contribution to the project.

Leadership Board

The Leadership Board is made up of individuals, community members and organizations that support and have direct stake in the project. The Leadership Board provides a vehicle for its members to communicate with and guide the overall direction of the project. The Leadership Board will meet up to twice per year as necessary. The role of the Leadership Board is to provide leadership, which includes guidence to the project, resources to the project and facilitation of the community.

Initial membership of the Leadership Board shall be boot-strapped by the founding project members. Leadership Board may be added by community nomination; and a 75% vote of all Leadership Board members given that the nominee provide significant vision and stake towards the project and is willing to take action on their particular vision. 

The members of the Leadership Board may be removed from the position at any time by a majority vote of the Committers and existing Leadership Board.

Founding Members

The responsibilty of the Founding Members is to provide sustainability and continuity to the project.

The Founding Members assert full authority and responsibility of the project with the guidence of the Leadership Board to ensure continuity during the initial boot-strapping process. The intent of this constitution is to provide long term sustainability and continuity to the project. At the point in which the project is deemed sustainably by the Leadership Board, the "Founding Members" roll will be combined with the Leadership Board role.

At times an issue may arise that merits gathering consensus from the community. Any Committer, Community Participant or Leadership Board member can suggest a referendum. To be accepted, a request for a referendum must be endorsed by 20% of any of (a) the Committers, (b) the Community Participants, (c) the Leadership Board members or (d) any of the Founding Members.

A 75% vote of all of the Committers can override a Leadership Board decision, but is left to the discretion of the Leadership Board.

The constitution may be amended by a 75% vote of the Leadership Board or at the discretion of the Founding Members.
