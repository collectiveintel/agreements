You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Foundation, your use, installation, copying, or distribution of the Software indicates your acceptance of this License.

3. Conflict between the LGPL and this Agreement

Any term or condition expressed in the LGPL, which conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, are to be deleted, prevailing the later over the former.

4. Scope of License

All rights of any kind to the Software, which are not expressly granted in this Agreement, are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by the Foundation. The Software is protected by applicable national and international laws and treaties.

You may use, install, copy, and distribute the Software solely as provided in this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense the Software in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so, unless an additional license is available for such scope.

In consideration of the license set forth herein, you agree to pay a license fee (“License Fee”).

The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) a copy of this Agreement signed by You and the Foundation or (ii) a valid Certificate of License Ownership, provided by the Foundation and addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name, the Software Name.

Legal Evidences are not transferable.

As part of this Agreement You implicitly accept the Foundation's "Contribution Agreement" 

6. Limitation on Releases

This agreement is valid for all Releases of the Software with Release Dates within or before the 365 days that follow the Effective Date (“Upgrade Period”). The Foundation has no obligation to provide you any Release that is not released for general distribution to other CIF licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate the Foundation to provide additional Releases to You under any circumstances.

7. Support

The Foundation shall provide support for Developers covered by valid Developer licenses for the period of 365 days following the Effective Date (“Support Period”). Support shall be limited to electronic messaging access. The Foundation shall keep You informed, either per CIF readiness or by following your request, including changes to it, about the rules and procedures that You must perform to enjoy support under the terms of this Agreement. Support topics shall be limited to the following (each a “Support Request”):

a) problem solving,
b) bug reporting,
c) and documentation clarification.
The number of Support Requests that the Foundation is entitled to accept from You is limited to 5 per month. The Foundation may refuse Support Requests that exceed these limits.

The Foundation is not in any way obliged to perform bug fixing or custom development activities as a result of a Support Request.

8. License Fee

In consideration for the License granted in this Agreement during the term of this Agreement, You agreed to pay to the Foundation a one time fee (“License Fee”).

In consideration for the Software upgrades access and support services provided during the Upgrade Period and Support Period, You shall pay a yearly fee (“Annual Support and Upgrade Fee”).

The License Fee and the Annual Support and Upgrade Fee amount shall be specified by the Foundation at the moment of the purchase as single unified price.

The fees listed in this Agreement do not include taxes. If the Foundation is required to pay any sales, use, property, excise, value added, gross receipts, withholding or other taxes levied on the Software or support under this Agreement or on Your use thereof, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by You. This Section does not apply to taxes based on the Foundation net income, franchise taxes or the Foundation's employer contributions and taxes.

You understand that the Foundation uses third-party paying agents to process selected payments. You understand that until payments are received and verified by the paying agent, this Agreement is not valid.

All payments made hereunder are nonrefundable. You may not withhold or set off any amounts due under this Agreement. Failure to pay any fee when due shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In addition, if You fail to make any payments when due for support, upon written notice to You, the Foundation shall cease providing support.

9. Automatic Renewal

You may opt to automatically extend the expiration date for both the Upgrade Period and Support Period by successive cycles of 365 days (each one a “Renewal”). In such case, you agree to pay a fee for each Renewal at the beginning of each cycle. The annual Renewal fee shall be informed by the Foundation at the moment of the purchase and optionally agreed by you.

If you opted to have automatic Renewals, the Foundation shall send you a payment request for the Renewal fee at any moment following the first day of each Renewal period. You shall perform the full payment in 30 calendar days following the payment request.

Both parties can discontinue the automatic Renewals by written notification to the other party before the beginning of extension cycles.

10. Exclusions from this License Grant

Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit the Foundation from licensing the Software under terms different from the LGPL or this Agreement. No other promises and rights are conceded by the Foundation other than those expressly under this Agreement.

11. Reservation of Rights and Ownership

You may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause. In case of termination, in any circumstance, payments issued by You will not be reimbursed.

You shall immediately discontinue distribution of Product, assembled with the Software, upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.
